Convert Telidon 699 to NAPLPS

Notes:
	-Converter is not complete, a number of opcodes not implemented
	-Textures do not always work, and are not always accurate
	-Font scaling is pretty good, but not perfect

Instructions:

Put a folder of Telidon 699 graphics files the same directory as the conversion program (699toNAPLPS.pl)

Run the script 699toNAPLPS.pl to convert the files to NAPLPS format
eg. ./699toNAPLPS.pl samples

This will create a copy of the folder in a directory called NAPLPS containing the converted files.
